description: >
  TurretIO is a Tower Defense game where you win by writing code. Made using the
  Godot game engine, the project has a custom built interpreter which allows for
  the control of in-game turrets using code. The language implemented is similar
  to Python. The game is meant to teach programming in a fun way for beginners.
  There are currently 8 levels implemented. Music credit goes to Kai Engel for
  the copyright-free track 'October'.  You can play the game

aim: >
  The aim of this project was to learn to use the Godot game engine and
  implement a full-fledged interpreter for a programming language, and also
  create a fun way for beginners to learn programming.
