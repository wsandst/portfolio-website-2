description: >
  A program which scrapes reported Covid-19 statistics from various government
  websites and submits them through Discord for manual review. The program uses
  a simple learning model which allows for semi-automated scraping of any
  website. It currently tracks all of Europe and all US states and Canadian
  provinces. The scraping is done using Selenium.
aim: >
  The project was designed to help the Covid-19 statistics tracking effort of
  the website [covid19-intel.com](https://www.covid19-intel.com/) by automating
  manual tasks and interfacing with their Discord submission system and their
  Google Sheet Backend.
