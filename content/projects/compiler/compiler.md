description: "<b>ccic</b> is a self-hosting C compiler, written in C. This means that the compiler can compile itself. The compiler supports most of the C language and outputs x86-64 NASM assembly/executables. The compiler includes simplified standard library headers."
aim: "The aim of this project was to learn compiler construction, better understand x86-64 assembly and do a deep-dive into the C language."
