description: >
  **ccic** is a self-hosting C compiler, written in C. This means that the
  compiler can compile itself. The compiler supports most of the C language and
  outputs x86-64 NASM assembly/executables. The compiler includes simplified
  standard library headers.
aim: > 
  The aim of this project was to learn compiler construction, better
  understand x86-64 assembly and do a deep-dive into the C language.
