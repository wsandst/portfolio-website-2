description: >
    A program made to visualize different Sorting Algorithms, with a modular implementation which allows very easy addition of additional algorithms. It currently has 15 separate algorithms implemented. There are several different options for visualizing a sort; for example, a bar graph or a disparity circle. There is also support for sound.
aim: >
    The aim of this project was to learn about many Sorting Algorithms, as practise for the course 'Datastructures and Algorithms'
