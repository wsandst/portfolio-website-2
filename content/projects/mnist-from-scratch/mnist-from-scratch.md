description: >
  A Machine Learning project which recognizes handwritten digits from the MNIST
  dataset with **97 % accuracy**. Written in Python using Numpy, completely from
  the ground up (no TensorFlow etc). Uses PyQT5 for a visual interface.
aim: The aim of this project was implement a neural network from scratch to
  learn the fundamentals of machine learning. It also served as a learning
  opportunity for the GUI framework QT5.
