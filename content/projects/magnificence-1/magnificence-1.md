description: >
    A UCI Chess Engine with an estimated ELO of 2000. This was my first larger C++ project made back in 2017 together with Harald Bjurulf. It uses an Alpha Beta Search with transposition tables and various other optimizations. The Board representation uses a Bitboard with a move generation speed similar to Stockfish.
aim: >
    The aim of this project was to implement a functional UCI Chess Engine using Bitboards as well as collaborate together with Harald Bjurulf on our first larger C++ project.
