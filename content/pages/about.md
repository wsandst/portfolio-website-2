      I'm William Sandström, a self taught full stack developer. This website is
      dedicated to my various projects and ventures. It serves as compendium
      over the things I have learned through the years.

      On a more personal side, I enjoy tea, reading and cats. I live in the small city of Umeå, located in northern Sweden.

      I started programming Python at the age of 15, which started a lifelong
      passion of programming. Later on I studied a few years of Computer Science
      at Umeå University, where I also had the opportunity to work as a teacher
      assistant. I am currently employed at Jo Kommunikation, a web agency, as a
      full stack developer. Previously I have also worked at Swedbank as a
      developer.
