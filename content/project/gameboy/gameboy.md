  [Try out the emulator online here!](/gameboy/) \

  CorrodedBoy is a Gameboy (DMG) Emulator written in Rust. It has two frontends,
  one available on the Web using Svelte and WebAssembly and the other using
  SDL2. It implements the Gameboy CPU, memory, graphics and audio hardware and
  allows for most Gameboy games to be played. The emulator passes most of
  Blarggs CPU tests as well as other tests, but is not completely cycle
  accurate.
aim: >
  The aim of this project was to understand the Gameboy hardware architecture in
  detail and how to emulate it properly, as well as to learn Rust and compiling
  it to WebAssembly.
